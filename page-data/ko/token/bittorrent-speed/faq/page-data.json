Bandwidth is needed for all operations on the TRON blockchain while energy is only needed for Smart Contracts. You get 1500 bandwidth free every day, this is about 5 operations. To get more, you can freeze or burn TRX. Freezing TRX gets you X of each resource a day, and you must keep the TRX frozen(staked) for 3 days. At the end of 3 days you can unfreeze (unstake) your TRX and get it all back. If you do not have enough resources, you will burn TRX. Once TRX is burnt, you will not get it back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can obtain more energy and bandwidth here: https://tronscan.io/#/wallet/resources</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate energy and bandwidth consumption, visit our calculator https://tronstation.io/calculator </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Energy:</strong> This is a special resource used to process smart contracts on the TRON network. Smart contracts consume Energy in addition to Bandwidth, so be sure you have enough of both when moving your tokens around! This is used for all SmartContracts (TRX20, TRC721, etc)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> Having TRON bandwidth allows you to perform transactions on the TRON mainnet without paying any gas fees.

Dangerous websites and risky Wi-Fi networks put your wallet at risk. At the same time, do not leave your device unattended or lend it to anyone.</li><li>Phishing scams through ads and through email are rampant in the crypto world. Phishing scams are becoming more and more elaborate, so make sure email received from wallet companies have their domain spelled correctly and never look for their web address clicking on ads. Once you send a phishing website your private key, you can say goodbye to your funds.</li><li>It’s important to double check the address to which you send any payment transaction. There are malicious programs that can edit a “copy and paste” procedure in order to paste a different address, and that new address belongs to an attacker. It’s usually best to send a micro payment as a verification and then send the larger payment to the verified address.</li></ul>\n\t\n\n\n\n\n","wordpress_id":8730,"id":"0a7bee4a-37dd-5dfd-9060-88370a61f41a","menu_order":0,"faq_cat":[1804],"faq_sect":[1807]}},{"node":{"title":"Which Operating Systems are currently supported by BitTorrent Speed?","content":"\nAll operating systems and browsers are supported by BitTorrent Speed.
