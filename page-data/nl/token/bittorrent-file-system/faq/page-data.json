BTT acts as a general purpose mechanism for transacting in computing resources shared between BitTorrent clients and a liquid market of service requesters and service providers. BTT is the unit denominating transactions for the provision of services in the BTT-enabled BitTorrent ecosystem. BTT is available as a divisible token, allowing for granular pricing. Adding a BTT token extends the familiar protocol to create a token-based economy for network resources, bandwidth, and storage resources on an existing BitTorrent network, giving network members the opportunity to appreciate the value of bandwidth and storage sharing.</p>\n","wordpress_id":8832,"id":"a4d2f4cd-0406-512b-9c52-285cb537de41","menu_order":1,"faq_cat":[1803],"faq_sect":[1816]}},{"node":{"title":"Can I store files onto the BTFS network?","content":"\n<p>Users can upload files to the BTFS network via a BTFS daemon.
