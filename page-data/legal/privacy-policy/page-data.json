If you have questions about our automated decision making, you may contact us as set forth in “<a href=\"#contact-us\" data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#contact-us\">Contact Us</a>” below.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Manage Downloads</strong>.&nbsp; The BitTorrent Client is a software application on your machine that manages downloads. The BitTorrent Client downloads files quickly by trading pieces with other users who are also downloading (or have downloaded) the same content. Your use of the BitTorrent Client to download files will, in turn, enable other BitTorrent Client users (or users of other clients that communicate using the BitTorrent Client protocol, including clients that are unaffiliated with BitTorrent) to download pieces of those files from you. Although your IP address is associated with your piece of the file, other users will not have access to any other personal information about you. <br><br>We do not track which files you transfer with the BitTorrent Client. Merely using the BitTorrent Client does not cause a record of which files you transfer to be kept by BitTorrent or BitTorrent on behalf of any third party.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>De-identified and Aggregated Information</strong>. We may use personal information and other information about you to create de-identified and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the device from which you access our Services, or other reports and analyses we create.
