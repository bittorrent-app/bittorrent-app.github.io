We have good news. Today, we will begin letting testers try out the Pre-Alpha. We are also unveiling its name: BitTorrent Bleep.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why Bleep, you might ask? Well, basically, we never see your messages or metadata. As far as we&#8217;re concerned, anything you say is &#8220;bleep&#8221; to us.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And with the susceptibility of communications platforms to snooping and hacking, reminders of which seems to surface every week, we realized that <a href=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/2014/07/30/building-an-engine-for-decentralized-communications/\">we were uniquely qualified to build a better platform and application</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our big idea was to apply distributed technology to conversations. That means no servers required. This enables people using Bleep to make <a href=\"https://engineering.gyre.wpengine.com/2013/12/19/update-on-bittorrent-chat/%20\">a direct, decentralized connection to someone they trust</a>. Bleep offers the freedom to communicate without the risk of metadata being exposed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consider Bleep your personal redaction pen controlled by you and only you. Anything you say is Bleep-ed out to us and everyone else for that matter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This unique approach to communicating will be a great tool for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Friends keeping conversations amongst friends</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Journalists communicating with sources without exposing their identity or their content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Members of the diplomatic corps sharing private dispatches</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Businesses keeping communications confidential, safe from leaks, and safe from industrial espionage</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Email invitations will start going out today to allow early testers access to our Pre-Alpha build of Bleep for the Windows desktop.  Here’s what you need to know about the Pre-Alpha version of Bleep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s Windows 7/8 desktop only (other platforms coming later)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s Pre-Alpha, so we’re aware of some bugs and are expecting our testers to find some more</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users can sign-up with email, mobile number, or incognito (unlisted; meaning no account or Personal Identifiable Information is necessary)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Testers will be able to invite friends, but those friends will also need to be using Windows desktop (for now)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Testers will have the option to import their Google address book locally to the application to quickly find friends</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Text and voice calls can be made to online contacts (no offline messages, yet)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The visuals, UI, and exposed features are still evolving; what is in the Pre-Alpha is not necessarily final</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, an account can only be used on a single device/installation and cannot be moved</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4811\" alt=\"BitTorrent Bleep\" src=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/07/Bleep-Hero.png\" width=\"709\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/07/Bleep-Hero.png 886w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/07/Bleep-Hero-300x175.png 300w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/07/Bleep-Hero-465x271.png 465w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’ve already signed up as a tester, we’ll be notifying you soon with an email that will include a link to the Windows installer.
