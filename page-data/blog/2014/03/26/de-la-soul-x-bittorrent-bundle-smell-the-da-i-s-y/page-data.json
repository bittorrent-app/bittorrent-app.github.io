It sounds like the Internet.</p>\n<p>De La Soul’s art, predicated on sampling and redefining ordinary recorded objects, is a template for 2.0 content: the creative core of remix culture. And it still reverberates. In <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/de-la-soul-to-make-entire-catalog-available-for-free-20140213\">February</a>, the group made their entire catalog &#8212; over seven albums &#8212; available for download.
