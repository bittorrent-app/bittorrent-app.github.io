Developed in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GE</a> and <a href=\"https://barbariangroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Barbarian Group</a>, <em>Drop Science</em> turns the sounds of GE’s machines into a song – transforming the hums and whirrs of industry into an orchestra.</p>\n</div><div class=\"wide\"><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5084\" alt=\"GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14\" src=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14.jpg 1920w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14-300x168.jpg 300w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14-465x261.jpg 465w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_14-940x528.jpg 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /><br />\n</div><div class=\"single-pad\">\n<p>In tackling the musicality of machines, there’s perhaps no artist better equipped than Matthew Dear. The musician, producer, and DJ has grappled with unique sounds and rhythms while exploring the themes of futurism, dystopia, and the more avant-garde realms of pop. Dear extends his boundary-pushing artistry to his own record label, <a href=\"https://ghostly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostly International</a>, which has become renowned for representing artists that transcend traditional pop sounds to provide something unique.</p>\n<p>As a result, <em>Drop Science</em> melds Dear’s aesthetic with GE’s tools to create an interactive, remix-friendly experience that not only invites the user to see and hear Dear’s work but to engage with it in his own way. This was achieved by providing a diverse media package, including art, GIFs, and samples that allowed users to create their own music from Dear’s recordings. But the diversity of material did not end at the Bundle itself: users could familiarize themselves with a video of Dear’s work at GE <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCUX4dDjhBQ\" target=\"_blank\">on Youtube</a>, and the song <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/generalelectric/drop-science\" target=\"_blank\">on SoundCloud</a>.</p>\n</div><div class=\"wide\"><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5085\" alt=\"Matthew Dear GE factory test image\" src=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_13.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_13.jpg 1920w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_13-300x168.jpg 300w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_13-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_13-465x261.jpg 465w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2014/09/GE_DROP_SCIENCE_13-940x528.jpg 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /><br />\n</div><div class=\"single-pad\">\n<p><strong>Since the Bundle dropped on 8/26, the results have been staggering:</strong></p>\n<p>&#8211; More than <strong>1.8 million impressions</strong> on the <em>Drop Science</em> Bundle Page<br />\n&#8211; More than <strong>1.6 million downloads</strong> (82% conversion)<br />\n&#8211; Nearly <strong>188,000</strong> streaming sessions<br />\n&#8211; More than <strong>42,000</strong> new email subscribers</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the majority of activity remained within BitTorrent despite activations on both SoundCloud and Youtube – meaning that users preferred the experience cultivated natively on our site. Not a bad start, considering <em>Drop Science</em> is the first project of its kind for BitTorrent.</p>\n</div><div class=\"wide\"><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/embed/bundles/generalelectric\" height=\"640\" width=\"940\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br />\n</div><div class=\"single-pad\">\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, the experience of <em>Drop Science</em> shows how much advertisements can provide an artistic value that goes beyond a few seconds. It can be an interactive medium that involves the audience in new and creative ways while still remaining true to brand goals.</p>\n<h2>About BitTorrent Bundle</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com\" target=\"_blank\">BitTorrent Bundle</a> is an alpha project made with and for the web’s creative community.
