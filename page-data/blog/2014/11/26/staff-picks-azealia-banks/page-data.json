A way for for fans to open source <em>Broke With Expensive Taste</em>: an <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/azealia-banks-long-twisted-road-to-broke-with-expensive-taste-20141125\" target=\"_blank\">album</a> that was three long (and well-fought) years in the making. Since Monday, nearly 17 thousand fans have downloaded the <a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/azealiabanks\" target=\"_blank\">BitTorrent Bundle</a> for &#8220;Chasing Time&#8221;. 1,214 have joined Banks’ <a href=\"https://smarturl.it/ABCTRemixLab\" target=\"_blank\">Remix Lab</a>, on Soundcloud. And to date, more than 272 remixes have been posted. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Chasing Time&#8221; almost didn’t make it on to <em>Broke</em>. Banks turned in the original album without the track.
