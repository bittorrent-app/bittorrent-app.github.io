Even on an increasingly green political landscape, any definition of a “reasonable consumption level” is going to be, to say the very least, “sensitive”.</p>\n<p>Some defensible ground remains in the areas of network congestion if one can stake out clear and reasonable technical arguments and actions defending those principles.  Being the target of a great many technologies currently deployed to shape, block and throttle (i.e. discriminate) it would be easy for BitTorrent to assume the role of victim in our little analogy.  I suspect there is a great deal of mileage to be had in this approach amid the fury of debate.  But this isn’t our plan.  Instead, we’ve spent considerable energy developing technologies in µTP to combat the underlying premise of discrimination, Internet congestion.    And while it remains to be seen how the market will react to these developments, whether the DPI currently deployed will be modified to discriminate against µTP as well, there is an opportunity for one side of the debate to stand behind their principles and in so doing demonstrate the potential of self regulation to the benefit of all.</p>\n<p>&#8211;Eric&#8211;</p>\n","date":"2009/10/15","featured_media":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"The Internet Civil Rights Act of 2009","description":"<p>I was recently invited to
