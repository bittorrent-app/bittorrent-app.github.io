Therefore, in early September, we will automatically update BitTorrent Classic for Mac to our newest torrent downloader and player, BitTorrent Web for Mac. This is necessary to ensure that our torrent downloading software continues to work seamlessly with Catalina when millions of users update to the new version.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t have plans to update your Mac OS to Catalina and wish to continue using BitTorrent Classic for Mac, you will be able to download the old version from our Web site after the automatic update occurs. However, please note that if you update your Mac OS to Catalina (version 10.15) sometime in the future, BitTorrent Classic for Mac will no longer work.</p>\n\n<h4>What will happen when I’m updated to BitTorrent Web for Mac?</h4>\n<p>Once inside the latest version of our new torrent software, you will notice a simplified interface and the ability to download and play torrent files and magnet links, all within your browser window. You’ll be able to download any file type to store locally in the folder of your choice, set download and upload speed limits to free up network resources for other internet tasks, and play torrent files while they download without needing to search folders or look for other media player apps.</p>\n \n<h4>Why is my BitTorrent client automatically upgrading?</h4>\n<p>Apple will no longer support 32-bit applications, including BitTorrent Classic for Mac, in the next operating system called Catalina (version 10.15). We created a completely new torrent downloader and player, BitTorrent Web for Mac, that will work on Mac OS Catalina.</p>\n\n<h4>When will my BitTorrent client update?</h4>\n<p>We will start updating users in early September. If you are using BitTorrent Classic for Mac version 1.87 or earlier version, you will automatically get upgraded to BitTorrent Web for Mac.</p>\n\n<h4>What is the difference between BitTorrent Classic for Mac and BitTorrent Web for Mac?</h4>\n<p>They work the same in that they are light, fast, and enable downloading of torrent files and magnet links. With BitTorrent Web for Mac, the torrent client lives in your browser as opposed to your desktop and you’ll notice a simplified interface that allows you to stream videos while you download files, without needing to wait for your downloads to complete. You will also be able to watch licensed videos for free.</p>\n\n<h4>What if I don’t want BitTorrent Web for Mac?</h4>\n<p>We will make BitTorrent Classic for Mac (version 1.8.7) available for download on our website. However, please note that if you update your Mac OS to Catalina (version 10.15) sometime in the future, BitTorrent Classic for Mac will no longer work.</p>\n\n<h4>Why did Apple make this change?</h4>\n<p>For more information about this change from Apple, please read the update Apple posted here &#8211; <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436</a></p>\n\n<h4>Does BitTorrent Web for Mac work on older versions of Mac OS?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it supports Mac OS version 10.11 and up. </p>\n\n<h4>Will BitTorrent Classic for Mac work on older versions of Mac OS?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it supports Mac OS version 10.14 or earlier.</p>\n\n<h4>How do I find out what Mac OS version I am on?</h4>\n<p>Step 1: Go to Apple Menu and select “About this Mac”</p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/08/mac-step1.png\">\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 25px;\">Step 2.
