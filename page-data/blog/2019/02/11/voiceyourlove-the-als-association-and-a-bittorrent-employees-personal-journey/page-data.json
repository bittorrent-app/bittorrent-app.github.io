We’re serving as proud sponsors for a remarkable awareness and fundraising campaign called #VoiceYourLove. In conjunction with The ALS Association, we’re joining our voices in the effort to end the deadly effects </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rather than directing his loss inward, Bailinson is the inspiration and guiding hand for a collaboration between ALS, BitTorrent and TRON that would raise awareness of the always-fatal disease and create a donation drive to help causes working to find a cure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“When I presented the idea of using the 100 million-plus BitTorrent and TRON community to do an awareness and fundraising campaign, it received great internal support,” Bailinson says. &nbsp;“I immediately reached out to The ALS Association in Washington, and over the next six months, we developed a close relationship that ended up by conceiving the VoiceYourLove concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kicking off in time for Valentine’s Day celebrations of love and affection, #VoiceYourLove challenges people to use their phone or tablet to create a video expressing love for people who’ve been meaningful to their lives &#8211; whether that’s family, friends, colleagues or even strangers. For those who wish to donate, </span><a href=\"https://voiceyourlove.org/?utm_source=TRON\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">voiceyourlove.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is the official campaign website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We&#8217;ve already attracted support from Renée Zellweger and Courteney Cox and expect more will come onboard. Over the next several days, we will be reaching out to our community through all the channels we have available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We also are launching a special ALS version of BitTorrent Web that features the celebrity videos, and we are engaging users inside our popular Windows desktop client and Android application to spread the word. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Justin Sun, CEO of BitTorrent and founder of TRON, is donating $250,000 to advance ALS research. He’s challenged people with means in the blockchain and tech industries to do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Says Bailinson: “It&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day this week, and I know that many people diagnosed with ALS often lose their ability to speak. Now’s the time to speak for them – and to speak out in support of a great cause like curing ALS. I’m doing my part to honor my sister and her memory, and I hope you can join me in doing the same by being a part of #VoiceYourLove.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8479\" src=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1880\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1.jpg 1880w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1-300x144.jpg 300w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1-768x368.jpg 768w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1-1024x490.jpg 1024w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1-465x223.jpg 465w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/als_logo-1-940x450.jpg 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1880px) 100vw, 1880px\" /></p>\n\n","date":"2019/02/11","featured_media":{"source_url":"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2019/02/ALS_blog.png"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"#VoiceYourLove, The ALS Association, and a BitTorrent Employee&#8217;s Personal Journey","description":"<p>#VoiceYourLove&nbsp;is a campaign to raise&nbsp;awareness for ALS&nbsp;and one of its many debilitating symptoms: losing the ability to speak.
