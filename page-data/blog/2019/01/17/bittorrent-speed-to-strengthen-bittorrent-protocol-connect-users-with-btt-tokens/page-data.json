With tokenized incentivization for seeding files, download speeds on peer-to-peer networks can get faster and become more readily available.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nBitTorrent Speed is undergoing extensive testing on the network to make it as seamless and reliable to users as the current client, according to Justin Knoll, head of BitTorrent Speed development. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\n“When users gain access to BitTorrent Speed, they will be blown away by the improvements we’ve made to the client they know and love today,” Knoll said.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bittorrent.com/btt\">BTT</a> will be exclusively available to non-U.S. accounts on <a href=\"https://launchpad.binance.com/\">Binance Launchpad</a>, the token sale platform, by leading cryptocurrency exchange <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/\">Binance</a> on January 28th, 2019, 7 AM PST. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nThe new tokenized features are backward-compatible with previous versions and will not affect users’ ability to download or seed.
