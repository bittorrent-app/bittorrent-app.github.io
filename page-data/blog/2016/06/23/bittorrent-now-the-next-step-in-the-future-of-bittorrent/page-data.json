We are something very unique on the Internet &#8212; an artist-first, people-powered platform, focused on creativity and community rather than abundance.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It was clear to me that this was a platform that deserved investment. By introducing ad-supported streaming for mobile devices &#8211; Android available now, iOS and Apple TV coming soon &#8211; BitTorrent Now is the first step toward creating an ever greater direct-to-fan platform.</p>\n<p>This is also our first step in creating truly awesome product experiences across mobile, television, and desktop platforms.</p>\n<p>So, why are we doing this? Because we believe we can help solve some of the most troubling problems facing creators in the digital age.</p>\n<p>The Internet has the promise of a direct connection between creators and fans. The ability to facilitate a dialogue and a collaboration. Yet, in the digital age, art has increasingly become commoditized. Existing platforms impose business models, format restrictions, algorithmic discovery; all of which are barriers between artists and fans … the creative vision and connection to fans is not a priority.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>\n<p>We believe we can help artists harness a powerful medium &#8211; the Internet &#8211; in a meaningful way. In a way that they can profit from distributing their work. In a way that empowers creators with data ownership and transparency.</p>\n<p>We believe art is about engagement, about connecting people. This is why we endeavour to build awesome experiences, to build platforms that allow creators to deliver the most engaging work possible. And to allow them to set the business model that best fits their unique work. And in a way that publishers can access and retain ALL consumer data. Engagement means transparency.</p>\n<p>And so following on the introduction of our live streaming app in May, we humbly submit our on-demand streaming apps for your consideration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://now.bt.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BitTorrent Now</a></p>\n<p>This is your platform. This has been built with thanks to the open dialogue with our artist partners and their fans. And we encourage you to keep the feedback coming; it keeps us working hard to do better and better.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Jeremy Johnson, with Robert Delamar</p>\n","date":"2016/06/23","featured_media":{"source_url":"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2016/06/grid.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"BitTorrent Now, the Next Step In the Future of BitTorrent","description":"<p>When I first came to BitTorrent, Inc.
