Already driven towards creative expression but never one to back down from a fight, just like his idol Tupac, it was a teenage Skyler who was drawn into the world of the streets, orbiting around hustlers and gang life.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_602675\" class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote\" data-block-type=\"31\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<figure>“I was going down a really serious path.

Skyler took the money he had saved from construction day jobs, took a trip to Miami with Redfoo, and the LMFAO rocket that would take the man now called Sky Blu into the music industry stratosphere was ignited.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_608222\" class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote\" data-block-type=\"31\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<figure>“Foo and I would go to these clubs and they would play electro. And then DJ AM gave us this CD, and it had all this electro on it. We thought, nobody’s rapping over this, we could rap over it. It could be a new wave, putting rap on a different sound.”</figure>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_609949\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>Despite what many believe, LMFAO’s success did not come easy, or come overnight. There were weeks, months, years of sleeping under a drum set in a studio apartment, sweating next to the 350 degree press they set up to make their own shirts, but when their breakthrough did happen, it happened on an astounding scale.</p>\n<h1><strong>To Consciousness</strong></h1>\n<p>From the outside LMFAO’s rockstar lifestyle looked like a dream come true, and in many ways it was. 8ky’s clearly grateful for those times, for all that Redfoo taught him, for the world of new opportunities that opened before him. But offstage and behind the scenes, a gap was beginning to open between the pair, and between the art 8ky felt driven to make and what the business side of the industry was demanding.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_613660\" class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote\" data-block-type=\"31\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<figure>“Foo and I, we had our differences, but when it came to the stage show that love was automatically there. That’s why we did it, we had love. LMFAO came from a real place.”</figure>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_615268\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>The pair’s time as a duo would eventually come to an end, and despite TMZ’ best efforts, the reasons behind the break up don’t really matter, not here. What really matters is that for the first time in years Skyler, now Sky Blu, was on his own. And on his own, the burden and blessing of figuring out who he was as a man and an artist was suddenly on his shoulders and his shoulders alone.</p>\n<p>Who was he, and what impact did that person want to have on the world?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_619287\" class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote\" data-block-type=\"31\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<figure>“I always had the want to do other styles of music. The label, they wanted this certain type of sound, and that wasn’t something I was comfortable with. And when the label started having influence, that’s when I started planning my exit.

True art comes from the heart &#8211; that’s really how I feel.”</figure>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_620693\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>The answer was 8ky.</p>\n<h1><strong>Fxck Yeah</strong></h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_737377\" class=\"sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code\" data-block-type=\"23\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://now.bt.co/embed/bundles/8ky-fxckyeah-chaos-to-consciousness\" width=\"100%\" height=\"540\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1473983472168_738546\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>For the past two years the man now known as 8ky has been making more than music.
