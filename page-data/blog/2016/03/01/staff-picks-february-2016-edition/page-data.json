Last year’s <em>Trillionaires</em> (<a href=\"https://www.breakworldrecs.com/\">Break World Records</a>) proved that Goth Money isn’t a genre. It’s a new geography for sound. The only way to follow <em>Trillionaires</em>, maybe, was with a chopped and screwed edition of the album. The record slows, the beats get heavier, the darkness closes in, and things get weird.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1456763024701_110076\" data-block-type=\"23\">\n<div><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/embed/bundles/goth-money\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1456763024701_110160\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/jimjoe2016\"><strong>JIM JOE: HUMAN BEING</strong></a></h3>\n<p>On Thursday February 25th, elusive artist Jim Joe released artwork supporting Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign, a collaboration with photographer Jamie-James Medina. The artwork is being made available as a free download via the website <a href=\"https://human-being.co/\" target=\"_blank\">human-being.co</a>, with full-res print files available via <a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/jimjoe2016\" target=\"_blank\">BitTorrent Bundle</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/krne-debris\"><strong>KRNE: DEBRIS EP</strong></a></h3>\n<p>The Bay Area producer and Fool’s Gold Records teamed up to share eight original tracks, exploring trap, electronic, and the spaces in between.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1456763024701_116776\" data-block-type=\"23\">\n<div><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/embed/bundles/krne-debris\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1456763024701_116860\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/haywyre\"><strong>HAYWYRE: TWO FOLD PT.
