Over the next year, BitTorrent aims to partner with 25 creators by providing cash grants and promotional support to build impactful releases and discover new fans. We are looking for artists, musicians, filmmakers, designers and other creators working on uncompromised projects representing a diverse, original perspective seeking global distribution. This open, international initiative has a rolling call (so you can apply when your project is ready) and provides $2,500- $100,000 in marketing and distribution funding to use at your discretion.</p>\n<p>We’ve worked with some of the most bold and talented artists today (<a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/major-lazer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Major Lazer</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/tomorrowsmodernboxes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thom Yorke</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/the-crash-reel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lucy Walker</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/hitspwyw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Cross</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/iheartcomix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IHEARTCOMIX</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/penny-lane-nuts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Penny Lane</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/for-your-pain-and-suffering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">De La Soul</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/live-in-telluride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pretty Lights</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/yung-jake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yung Jake</a>, <a href=\"https://now.bt.co/bundles/collective-unconscious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lily Baldwin, Frances Bodomo, Daniel Patrick Carbone, Josephine Decker, and Lauren Wolkstein</a> just to name a few) and are looking to incubate the world’s next wave of awesome, straight-up brave storytellers and outside voices.</p>\n<p>If that sounds like you, we’d love to hear what you are working on and invite you to <a href=\"https://bittorrent.com/discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apply here</a>.</p>\n","date":"2016/08/26","featured_media":{"source_url":"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2016/08/Billboard-NYC_2014_5-1-cropped.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"BitTorrent Launches The Discovery Fund","description":"<p>Last December, we asked independent artists to weigh in on the present and future of creative sustainability.
