We’ve seen the stories: how the season finale set a new &#8220;BitTorrent Piracy Record”, allegedly downloaded by 5.2 million people worldwide. And on that note: we’d like to set the record straight. </p>\n<p>The idea of a &#8220;BitTorrent Piracy Record” is a complete fabrication. Because there’s actually no such thing as a “BitTorrent piracy record”. Because piracy happens outside the BitTorrent ecosystem. </p>\n<p>We don’t host infringing content. We don’t point to it. It’s literally impossible to “illegally download something on BitTorrent.” To pirate stuff, you need more than a protocol. You need search, a pirate content site, and a content manager. We offer none of those things. If you’re using BitTorrent for piracy, you’re doing it wrong. </p>\n<p>These so-called “records” are presumably based on numbers from pirate websites that have no affiliation with BitTorrent, Inc. If they’re corroborated using data from pirate websites, they’re &#8220;Internet Piracy Records&#8221;. They’re not &#8220;BitTorrent Piracy Records&#8221;. </p>\n<p>BitTorrent; the open-source protocol, the company, was built for innovation. We don’t endorse piracy. We don’t tally up illegal downloads, and crown pirate-kings. But these kinds of stories give us the opportunity to tell the truth about what’s going on inside BitTorrent. </p>\n<p>In partnership with the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a>, artists, labels and studios, we’ve made more than two million pieces of licensed, legal content available for download over the BitTorrent protocol. We’ve built a legit media ecosystem designed to close the gap between creators and fans. In 2012 alone, titles from this collection have been downloaded over 152 million times. </p>\n<p>So, we took a look the real BitTorrent numbers; the ones we can verify through our <a href=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/2013/05/07/the-bittorrent-bundle-alpha-a-direct-to-fan-collaboration-with-ultra-music/\">BitTorrent Bundle program</a>. We discovered that the real king of BitTorrent isn’t Game of Thrones. With 8,626,987 downloads, hands-down-most-downloaded show of 2013 via BitTorrent is <a href=\"https://bit.ly/147YkX5\">Epic Meal Time</a>; a show -published into BitTorrent willingly and legally by the creators themselves. That’s nearly double the claimed downloads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> finale. </p>\n<p>Let’s be clear; we are huge fans of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and we encourage you to watch it &#8211; legally. But the Internet has spoken. And, honestly: we can’t say we’re surprised that bacon won BitTorrent. </p>\n","date":"2013/06/25","featured_media":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"The Real King of BitTorrent","description":"<p>We’ve watched the myth of Game of Thrones unfold online.
