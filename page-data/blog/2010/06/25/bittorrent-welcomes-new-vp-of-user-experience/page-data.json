As part of that continued evolution we have brought on David Gómez-Rosado as the Vice President of User Experience.</p>\n<p>Obviously, a huge focus for us is making sure that we deliver an optimal user experience, which packs in useful functionality while improving on usability and staying true to our lightweight yet feature rich values. In the past several months we have started to introduce significant new functionality to the client. David will be charged with pushing forward the design to address the needs of our users today, while also creating a vision of what users will want and need tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Most recently, David held the same title at Lithium Technologies, the leading provider of Social CRM solutions to power the customer network. During his time there he was responsible for managing user experience for all of Lithium’s products, ensuring consistency and improvement of their design throughout the suite of products. He has also held similar positions at Ask.com and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>We are very excited to have him join the team, and have no doubt that he will be critical in driving the development of an even better user experience.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Eric &#8211;</p>\n","date":"2010/06/25","featured_media":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"BitTorrent Welcomes New VP of User Experience","description":"<p>Over the last several months the BitTorrent and µTorrent clients have evolved a lot.
