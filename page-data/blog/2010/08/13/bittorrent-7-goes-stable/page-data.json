We believe that μTP, an updated BitTorrent protocol that makes efficient use of bandwidth while reducing network problems, is a critical component in continuing to drive that legacy forward. μTP is an enhanced BitTorrent transfer protocol that we introduced in our μTorrent client a few months back. While BitTorrent 6.x clients partially supported it, the new BitTorrent 7 client now has support for μTP on a par with the popular μTorrent software.</p>\n<p>In addition to μTP there are several other improvements in BitTorrent 7 including:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">&#8211; UDP NAT-traversal – an improved way to find peers who might otherwise be stuck behind firewalls;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">&#8211; Transfer Cap feature – a way to limit the total bytes transferred by your client in a specific period, to keep you in line with any limits imposed by your ISP;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">&#8211; UDP Tracker support – a way to reduce the load on trackers and improve performance.</p>\n<p>The technology on which the μTP protocol is based is also available as an open source software library published <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span>. Several other BitTorrent clients either have implemented μTP support or are now considering it. We hope we will continue to see wider adoption of μTP across the BitTorrent ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In many ways, μTP is a get-smart approach to managing traffic on the network. Where its predecessor TCP could only detect a problem on the network once a packet was dropped and when a user’s Internet connection had slowed to a crawl, μTP can slow itself at the earliest signs that the network is getting overloaded &#8211; avoiding problems before they become acute. While some users have been concerned that they don’t want a BitTorrent client that slows itself down, the somewhat counter-intuitive result is that by automatically avoiding over-aggressive behavior, the downloads tend to actually go faster.</p>\n<p>We continue to see µTP as a mutually beneficial solution for users and ISPs. Moreover, we believe that it is in the best interest of all parties when all stakeholders do their part to preserve a neutral Internet and self-regulate. BitTorrent Inc. is grounded in innovation, and µTP is the natural progression in ensuring that the Internet can scale and continue to evolve to meet users’ ever-changing demands.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Simon &#8211;</p>\n","date":"2010/08/13","featured_media":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"BitTorrent 7 Goes Stable","description":"<p>Fundamentally, BitTorrent is about creating a more efficient and open Internet.
