BitTorrent representatives will never request personal information from you other than what is needed, such as your email address, to answer your inquiry. Most importantly, we will never request your BTT private key or recovery phrase. BitTorrent will never ask you to send BTT to an address as part of a promotion or as a participation fee.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>Please remember that the BitTorrent protocol is made up of a decentralized network. We as a company do not have a way to contact you unless you previously contacted us through customer support.
