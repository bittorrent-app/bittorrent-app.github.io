Our teams will be working together to bring blockchain-based peer-to-peer content sharing, including live streaming, to the BitTorrent community and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLive boasts a friendly community of content creators and viewers and a revolutionary rewards system. Broadcasters and viewers may earn token rewards without sharing any of their earnings with the platform, enabling creators to enjoy contributions from their community. This is in stark contrast to traditional, centralized entities which take as much as 50% of the creator’s revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLive will use our new BitTorrent File-Sharing System (BTFS), a distributed file sharing and storage system. This endeavor will not only extend even more benefits to the community yet also drive DLive closer to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While DLive will continue to support the Lino blockchain until the transition to the TRON blockchain is complete, BitTorrent&#8217;s token (BTT) will eventually become the unit of value in the new ecosystem. Stay tuned as DLive expects to offer various benefits and rewards to existing users when the time comes to transition from Lino to BTT.<br></p>\n","date":"2020/01/08","featured_media":{"source_url":"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2020/01/bittorrent_blog_dlive_1024px.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"DLive Joins BitTorrent Ecosystem","description":"<p>We are excited to announce DLive, the popular blockchain-based live streaming platform, is joining the BitTorrent ecosystem.
