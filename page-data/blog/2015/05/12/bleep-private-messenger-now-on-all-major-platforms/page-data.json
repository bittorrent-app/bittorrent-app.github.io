Services have come and gone, some have been breached and patched, and in many cases, users have been left feeling violated, or at the very least, changed what they say or do online.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been listening. Listening to our community&#8217;s feedback as well as the dialogue that has been taking place around privacy, data-collection, and the social cost of technology bringing us closer together. We&#8217;ve decided that one of those costs should not be your identity. And by identity, we don&#8217;t just mean your personal details, but also what you choose to say and how you say it. And with that in mind, we are releasing our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/bleeppm\" target=\"_blank\">latest version of Bleep</a>.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<strong>No Personal Info Required.</strong><br />\nTo get started with Bleep, all that is required is choosing a nickname. You can share your Bleep key (under Settings:Profile) wherever you like: forum post, twitter page, etc. And no one will have any of your other details. Optionally, you can verify your email addresses and mobile numbers with Bleep, which will let your friends discover you through Bleep when they open an account.</p>\n<p><strong>In Your Hands, Instead of the Cloud.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://2chie424y5ug2kfkkypuhcvwq2.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2014/09/bleep-blog-logo1-940x539.png\" target=\"_blank\">Bleep&#8217;s logo</a> represents a folded note &#8211; a message passed directly, hand-to-hand. In our implementation, we keep messages and the encryption keys for images stored on your local device, not the cloud. For messages and metadata, there is no server for hackers to target and because you hold the keys, images can&#8217;t be leaked to haunt you later. We&#8217;ve solved serverless peer-to-peer messaging, including the ability to get offline friends your messages when they come back online.</p>\n<p><strong>Be Bold, with a Whisper.</strong><br />\n</div><div class=\"wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7062\" alt=\"Bleep Message to Whisper crop\" src=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop.png\" width=\"1632\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop.png 1632w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop-300x122.png 300w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop-1024x416.png 1024w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop-465x189.png 465w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop-940x382.png 940w, https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/bleep-message-to-whisper-crop-470x190.png 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1632px) 100vw, 1632px\" /></div><div class=\"single-pad\">\n<p>Brand new for this release, is the ability to send whisper messages with Bleep. For parts of a conversation that you&#8217;d like to keep temporary, tapping “Go to Whisper” on your phone sends messages and pictures that disappear from devices after they&#8217;ve been viewed (25 seconds); holding Ctrl on PC and shift on Mac while hitting send does this on your desktop. You can switch back and forth between normal and whisper messages seamlessly, so you don&#8217;t lose the flow of your conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenshot, or Not?</strong><br />\nWhisper messages have additional protection for screenshots. If a friend manages to capture the screen, they won&#8217;t be able to capture who said what, since nicknames are blocked out. And if you forget who you&#8217;re whispering with, you tap the &#8220;eye&#8221; to display the nickname, but the conversation gets blurred. They can capture the conversation or the sender, <a href=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-08-12.42.51.png\" target=\"_blank\">but not both at the same time</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Adding friends is easy&#8230;</strong><br />\nInvite friends via your device&#8217;s address book, their email, mobile number or Bleep key. In situations where you want to add a friend in-person, you can scan/share a Bleep code (tap &#8220;+&#8221;, tap &#8220;Bleep Code&#8221;).</p>\n<p><strong>Free Voice Calls.</strong><br />\nStart a Bleep-to-Bleep call with any online contact by tapping the phone icon at the top of your text conversation. Calls are connected directly (no cloud), with end-to-end encryption.</p>\n<p><strong>iPhone, iPad, Android and Desktops&#8230;</strong><br />\nBleep is now available on iOS, and has significant updates on Android, in addition to being available for Mac and Windows desktop. Each device you own is registered with Bleep separately, but you can add your friends to each device stay in touch.</p>\n<p>Bleep is available now at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/bleeppm\" target=\"_blank\">www.bleep.pm</a>. And if you have any feedback, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/bleepfeedback\" target=\"_blank\">we&#8217;d love to know</a> what you think. We&#8217;d also like to thank all our testers for helping us get to this exciting release.</p>\n<div class=\"button-wrap text-center\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/bleeppm\" target=\"_blank\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-bt  \">Get Bleep Now</button></a></div>\n\n\n","date":"2015/05/12","featured_media":{"source_url":"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/05/01_bleep_blog_hero_0001_logo.png"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"Bleep Now Publicly Available Across All Major Platforms","description":"<p>Private Messaging App Rolls Out for iOS and Adds &#8220;Whisper&#8221; Messages Since our open alpha release last September, a lot has happened in the private messaging space.
