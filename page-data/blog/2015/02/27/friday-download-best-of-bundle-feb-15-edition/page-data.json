On February 2nd, the song made its network debut, scoring Coca-Cola’s anti-bullying ad. It became part of culture, securing a place on Billboard’s Emerging Artists chart. And it became something more: a way to make a difference. More than 360,000 people around the world downloaded the original “Show Me Love” Bundle in exchange for a donation to Big Brothers Big Sisters.

In just under a decade, Alex Ridha’s BNR has become home to electronic’s pulsing, weird, and unpredictable underground. To mark ten years, BNR issued a BitTorrent Bundle packed with five hours of music from the last 3,650.</p>\n</div><div class=\"wide\"><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"940\" height=\"700\" src=\"//bundles.bittorrent.com/embed/bundles/boysnoize\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n</div><div class=\"single-pad\">\n<h3>David Cross: <em>HITS</em></h3>\n<p>HITS, the new film from comedian/writer/director David Cross, explores fame, delusion, and the impact of social media on society.
