Up against all that, it made sense to get the hell out and go somewhere. (Even vicariously.) September’s Staff Picks are all about exploration. Alex Winter took us inside the web’s underground black markets with Deep Web. Future Classic’s 2015 Sampler brought us inside Australia’s emerging electronic scene. Sneakerheads shed light on streetwear’s obsessive subcultures, from Fairfax to Tokyo. If you’re looking to make your escape: here are ten projects to get lost in.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/deepweb\"><strong>BOND360: DEEP WEB</strong></a></h3>\n<p>In May, Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road, was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
