It’s now something bigger, and stranger: in 2014, more than 130,000 people camped out, queued up, and changed into their costumes. Doug Benson’s <em>Chronic Con</em>provides a hazy lens on the convention floor, as we follow Benson on his quest to get high, find filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, and smoke with real life super-hero. In between, we get a laid-back and fully-baked look into the world of Comic Con weirdness.
