It’s a vision for the Internet that we’ve long held at BitTorrent; we believe its a necessary innovation to sustain a <a href=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/2014/04/24/net-neutrality-we-need-a-better-deal/\">truly neutral, content-friendly network</a>.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nAt that time we asked, what if more of the web worked the way that BitTorrent does? <em>Project Maelstrom</em> aims to answer that question with a web browser that powers a new way for web content to be published, accessed and consumed. </p>\n<p>Since December, we have learned a lot. We also have established a growing community of testers, developers and publishers. More than 10,000 developers in fact, and an additional 3,500 publishers, looking to share our vision of how the Internet can work. These are technologists, academics and researchers. These are start-ups, agencies, and visionaries. And these are the people who will help us build the next 20 years of the Internet. </p>\n<p>Today, <em>Project Maelstrom</em> enters its next phase by expanding our group of testers and by offering a new set of <a href=\"https://blog.bittorrent.com/2015/04/10/project-maelstrom-developer-tools/\">developer tools</a>. </p>\n<p>Our test group will be expanded with the introduction of the <a href=\"https://project-maelstrom.bittorrent.com/\"><em>Project Maelstrom</em> browser beta</a>. This is an open beta for Windows users and by empowering the browser with a distributed protocol we open a better future for publishers, creators, and users. And we do this while offering a more efficient, scalable and cost-effective alternative to HTTP.</p>\n<p>The latest release also introduces the first developer tools for <em>Project Maelstrom</em>, empowering publishers and developers to leverage the efficiency of BitTorrent technology in their content and interactive experiences.</p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re expanding access to everyone so that tomorrow we will have a sustainable, content-friendly Internet, powered by people.</p>\n<div class=\"button-wrap text-center\"><a href=\"https://project-maelstrom.bittorrent.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-bt  \">Get the Beta</button></a></div>\n","date":"2015/04/10","featured_media":{"source_url":"https://blog.bittorrent.com/files/2015/04/Project_Maelstrom_Blog_3.png"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"meta":{"title":"Project Maelstrom Enters Beta","description":"<p>Distributed Browser Expands Test Group, Introduces Developer Tools In December we announced the release of the alpha version of Project Maelstrom and shared our vision for a distributed web.
