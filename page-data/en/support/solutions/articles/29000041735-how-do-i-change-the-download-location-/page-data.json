Your network connection is poor (common) or you are not actually connected to wifi.  To check this, try streaming content on your browser or an app (e.g YouTube).  If you can stream content without too much buffering, then you probably have a strong connection. Alternatively, check your wifi speed with the free Speed Test app from Google Play.  2. Your wifi network connection is blocked by the ISP.  This means your network is blocking torrent files, or is blocking your outgoing port.  To check this, try downloading a Featured Content torrent on another network.  If you can download a torrent on another network (particularly a fast wifi network), then it’s likely that your wifi network is causing the issue.  To fix this, tap on Menu, then Settings, then Incoming TCP Port in our app.  Look at the TCP Port number, and increment it up by one.  For example, if your port number is 6881, make it 6882. If this doesn’t work, your wifi network may be throttling BitTorrent traffic, in which case we can't help with a workaround.      ","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":""},"tags":["BT Android HC"],"attachments":[],"cloud_files":[],"thumbs_up":8,"thumbs_down":13,"hits":1049,"suggested":0,"feedback_count":0,"hierarchy":[{"level":0,"type":"category","data":{"id":29000035457,"name":"BitTorrent Android App","language":"en"}},{"level":1,"type":"folder","data":{"id":29000058015,"name":"Troubleshooting","language":"en"}}]},{"id":29000041765,"type":1,"status":2,"agent_id":29004395067,"created_at":"2022-09-24T05:14:01Z","category_id":29000035457,"folder_id":29000058015,"title":"How do i remove (not pause) a torrent when it's finished seeding?","updated_at":"2022-10-19T21:15:22Z","description":"<p><span>Go to your torrent list, then long press on the torrent. &nbsp;A trash can will display. &nbsp;Tap on the trash can, which will ask if you also want to delete the files. &nbsp;Select your option and then tap Delete.</span></p>","description_text":" Go to your torrent list, then long press on the torrent.  A trash can will display.  Tap on the trash can, which will ask if you also want to delete the files.  Select your option and then tap Delete.
